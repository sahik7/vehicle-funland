                <br />
                <p >Ans - Access and refresh token both protected that data in the server by ensuring security access while authentication and authorisation processes.

                    Access token has limited time frame for usage. Whereas,  the refresh token has no time limit. client can use it to request a new access token.

                    Access tokens must be kept in a secure place but in server-side browser memory such as session storage, local storage, secure HTTP-Only Cookies, Although it is not recommended.

                    Refresh tokens need to store in the secure http only cookies, secure token storage,  token vault.
